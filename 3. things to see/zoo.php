The zoo contains many native and non-native animals and wild life, and hosts about three million visitors each year. The name of zoo has been changed 5 February 2015 from Dhaka Zoo to Bangladesh National Zoo.<br>

The zoo attracts around 10,000 visitors every day with the number increasing during the weekends and holidays. The zoo is also known for its poor conditions for animals and the corruption of its officials.<br>
			    The yearly budget of Dhaka Zoo is Tk 37.5 million, out of which Tk 25 million is spent on feeding the animals.<br>
				The zoo is currently home to 2,150 animals from 134 species. The zoo exhibits 58 species of mammals, including elephants, cheetahs, rhinos, zebras, waterbucks, otters, hyenas, deer, giraffes, impala, black bears, tapirs, hippos, lions, many species of monkeys, chimpanzees, baboons, and Bengal tigers.

The two lakes at the zoo also host migratory water birds each winter. Visitors can also see 13 species of reptiles including snakes and crocodiles, and 28 species of fish.<br>
				After a number of animal deaths in 2009, the zoo curator and deputy curator were temporarily suspended and a committee was formed to investigate the deaths. Zoo administration claimed that its main problem was the lack of veterinary doctors (it had only one doctor), and that it had already requested additional veterinary staff. The zoo is noted by international agencies as corrupt, and when two black rhinoceros were sent from South Africa to Dhaka in 2013.

Surrounding the Safari Park is a permanent cemetery and there has been an opportunity for the breeding of indigenous / foreign wildlife and free movement so tourists will be able to travel, walk or walk on foot, study, and entertain. The concept of Safari Park is different from the zoo. In the zoo the animals are locked and visitors visit the animals from free time. But wild animals in the Safari Park will roam freely in the forests and people are careful to carry on running vehicles.

				Within Nijhum Dwip National Park live about 30,000 people, most of whom are poor, highly vulnerable to cyclones, and dependent on fishing, grazing and other natural resources. Strengthening livelihoods in ways
				that reduce pressure on the biodiversity and ecology of Nijhum Dwip NP, including zoning, wildlife protection and sustainable fisheries, are a high priority.
