                Bangladesh is a low-lying country. The only exceptions are the Chittagong Hills in the southeast, the Low Hills of Sylhet in the northeast and highlands in the north and northwest. Kala pahar(1,098 ft) is the highest point of greater Sylhet and also the northern part of Bangladesh. The Chittagong Hills, which constitute the only significant hill system in the country, rise steeply to narrow ridge lines, with altitudes from 600 to 1000 meters above sea level. At 1063 m(3,488 ft) altitude, the highest elevation in Bangladesh is Saka Haphong at Mowdok range, in the southeastern part of the hills. Highly elevated peaks of this area can also be called mountains as hills above 2000 ft(600m) with a distinct peak are referred as mountains. 75 such mountains have been identified and mapped in the Hill Tracts. Fertile valleys lie between the hill lines, which generally run north-south. West of the Chittagong Hills is a broad plain, cut by rivers draining into the Bay of Bengal, that rises to a final chain of low coastal hills, mostly below 200 meters, that attain a maximum elevation of 350 meters. West of these hills is a narrow, wet coastal plain located between the cities of Chittagong in the north and Cox's Bazar in the south.
